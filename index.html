                        Even small local businesses that only serve their hometown need a site. That's because the web
                        is
                        the first place people go when looking for a product or service. A website helps every business:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Promote and sell their products and services</li>
                        <li>Connect with new customers (and keep existing customers)</li>
                        <li>Build credibility</li>
                        <li>Compete with bigger businesses</li>
                        <li>Control their brand and keep their marketing fresh and current</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Best of all, a website is much easier and more affordable than you might think. GoDaddy offers a
                        complete selection of online tools for building websites, along with hosting, email and
                        marketing
                        options to grow their business on the web.
